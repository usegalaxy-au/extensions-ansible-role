  # NOTE: Molecule integration tests are not run in CI due to Python interpreter
  # discovery issues when delegating tasks from Docker containers to GitHub Actions
  # runners. The custom Ansible module requires access to role template files on
  # the controller, which necessitates delegation to localhost. However, Ansible's
  # interpreter auto-discovery doesn't work correctly in this delegated context in CI.
  #
  # Molecule tests work perfectly when run locally. To run them:
  #   molecule test -s default
  #   molecule test -s templating
  #   molecule test -s versions
  #
  # See TESTING.md for more details on running tests locally.
